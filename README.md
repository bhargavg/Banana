# Banana üçå üêí [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bhargavg/Banana.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bhargavg/Banana) [![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)


Banana is a library that allows conversion of parsed JSON into typed objects.

Why another JSON mapper right? 

The idea behind creating Banana is to show that JSON mapping is not as complicated.

Simplicity and no-black-magic are the key design principles. The name Banana is chosen to signify this. 

If you are interested in how this libary has evolved, please read [this blog post series](http://bhargavg.com/swift/2016/03/29/functional-json-parsing-in-swift.html)

## Features
- Error handling through `do-try-catch` mechanism
- Handles Optionals
- Supports Keypaths

## Installation

Only `Carthage` is supported as of now. Adding `CocoaPods` support is in pipeline.

### [Carthage]

[Carthage]: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage

To add this library to your project, just add the following to your `Cartfile`

```
github "bhargavg/banana"
```

and `carthage update`. For full list of command, please refer [Carthage documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)


## Examples

### Read a single value
```swift
let value: String = try Banana.load(file: "simple") <~~ keyPath("path.to.key")
```

### Mapping to models and back
```json
[
    {
        "x": "hi",
        "y": 5
    },
    {
        "x": "yolo",
        "yo": 6
    }
]
```

```swift
struct Foo {
    let x: String
    let y: Int

    static func fromJSON(json: JSON) throws -> Foo {
        return Foo(
                    x: try get(json, key: "x"),
                    y: try get(json, keys: ["y", "yo"])
                  )
    }

    static func toJSON(foo: Foo) -> JSON {
        return ["x": foo.x, "y": foo.y]
    }
}

let foos: [Foo] = try Banana.load(file: "foos_file") <<~ Foo.fromJSON
print(foos)

let jsonString: String = try foos <<~ Foo.toJSON <~~ Banana.dump(options: [.PrettyPrinted]) <~~ Banana.toString(encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)
print(jsonString)
```

- [ ] CocoaPods Support
- [ ] SwiftPM Support
- [ ] OSX, Watch, TvOS Targets
